# Auto Dice Cleanup

## Install

Currently, you need to either follow the build guide down below or use the R2ModMan. 

## Usage
The plugin allows you to configure how long dice will persist on the board before automatically cleaning them up. This allows you to forget the dice and allows TaleSpire to clean them up after an extended period of time.

## Changelog
- 1.1.0: DiceManager patch fixed to support the latest TaleSpire version
- 1.0.1: Minor Patch, update logging
- 1.0.0: Initial release
